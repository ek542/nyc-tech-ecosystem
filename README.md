# nyc-tech-ecosystem

## Objective

Why are we doing this? Who benefits from the work we do here? What does success look like? When are we done?

No one has created a comprehensive inventory of the Urban Tech sector in NYC. We feel this sector has a lot of growth potential and is crucial to the recovery of NYC. Creating an inventory of the space will help galvanize and promote the sector, which is in fulfillment of the UT Hubâ€™s mission to promote Urban Tech. 
Our audience is the group of NYC tech promoters who are interested in Urban Tech. Also the academic cohorts who are interested in defining what Urban Tech is.

We will use this repository to build the charts, plots, and maps using Airtable files that we have created that will be used for a public-facing application built on Streamlit.
