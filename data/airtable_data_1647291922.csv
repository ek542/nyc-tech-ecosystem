Just want to make sure we avoid any confusion in outside observers assuming EDC was founded in 2016, and only has 26 employees, and if you are interested in a subgroup within EDC, I also want to make sure I’m clear on which subgroup that is (Urbantech NYC team has never had 26 employees, so wondering if the original unit of analysis was the entire department?).

Thanks for all the great work you’re doing in this space.

----

Think just calling EDC broadly urban tech is right — provides enabling infrastructure for the sector (and/or the canvas for it), that characterization won’t offend any sensibilities, and is at least mostly right. Also much easier than going hyper-granular (to the level of project basis).

I think right now we have around 500 employees total. If you need more specific # let me know.

EDC is a story of incarnations and iterations, so feel free to take your pick in terms of founding date — 
\- 1966: New York City Public Development Corporation, born to resuscitate flagging economy and manage industrial parks/urban planning services (I’d use this one)
\- 1979: Financial Services Corporation founded in parallel to PDC but more focused on capital than land (this is also where NYCIDA was born)
\- 1991: NYC Economic Development Corporation created when PDC and FSC merged into single entity as part of City plan to consolidate various providers of economic development services (this is first time the name came about and all services under one roof)
